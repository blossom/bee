## Nexted Example

A button which opens an overlay on click. The overlay contains a popover.
Note: Pressing 'ESC' closes popovers as well as overlays but only closes the youngest (last shown) component.

```html
<x-button type="button" on-click="query('.q-example-nested').xtag.show()" on-touch-start="query('.q-example-nested').xtag.show()">Launch Overlay</x-button>
<x-overlay width="600px" class="q-example-nested">
